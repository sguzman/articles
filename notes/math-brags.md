# Math Brags
A list of my math brags. Stuff I discovered independently from founders in my own research

# Stuff
- Linear Homotopy `(1-a)*f[x]+ a*g[x]`
- Multiplicative Mixture vs Additive Mixture
  - The first is interwoven: ABABABABA. The second is isolated chunks: AAAAABBBBBB
- Using the dot-product to determine functional resonance
