- Nested riemann sum: While taking a riemann sum, use another riemann to calculate the error of the raw sum
- Using the Dirac Delta function as a zero-detector. Feed it a formula that = 0. Integrate it dirac delta function; then what results is a step function that takes a step function that takes a step at every 0
