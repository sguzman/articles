# Computer Research
A list of topics in computer science that I wish to iterate on one day. I believe them to be important cornerstones for our technological utopian future

## Topics
- Rust compiler macro that imports file resources so that comptime optimizations can be done
- Defining grammars for data files (JSON, CSV, HTTP Request) and slurping data into file (failing on bad parse)
- Rust compiler macro that imports HTTP requests into source code for comptime optimizations
- Splitting compile time into compile_n generations for further optimization
- Pre-runtime compile time vs Pre-written compile time
- Using smart and comprehensive compiler to verify integrity of runetime process
- Meta programming language environment for types
- Type theoritcal environment to model the type dynamics of other programming languages
