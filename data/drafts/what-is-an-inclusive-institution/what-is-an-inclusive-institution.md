# What is an Inclusive Institution?

## Introduction

By virtue of happenstance, modern schools have become beneficiaries of the
progressive tradition. There is no exhaustive promulgation of the advance of
progressive politics without countenance of how that activism has indelibly
changed all facets of the school. It is a particular facet of this experience
that I wish to dwell on. When dissecting the modern public school, the vantage
points for accumulation of progressive predilections are many. As active
institutions, schools must designate by some design what are the decisions that
will guide conduct of agents within on pragmatic and ideological grounds. This
should not be a surprise to anyone as any organization must formally develop and
envelop themselves as actors within some contextual framework.

## Invitation to Inquiry

What are the sources of philosophical inquiry that shape such an institution? Do
the subsequent policies developed give satisfactory answers to these questions?
Is the act of existence itself progress towards these inquiries? What is the
nature of the formalisms employed that service the institution? What is the
mission statement of the institution? Does the nature of the institution allow
for public analysis? Does the incumbent administration treat with hostility
discourse that is critical of the institution? Do they distinguish between
criticism aligned with their mission statement? These are answers that beg for
immediate remedial discovery and often their existence is a venture to
disambiguate between the lofty ambitions from the prima facie reality.
