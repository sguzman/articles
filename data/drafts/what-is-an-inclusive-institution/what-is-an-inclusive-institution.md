# What is an Inclusive Institution?

## Introduction

By virtue of happenstance, modern schools have become beneficiaries of the
progressive tradition. There is no exhaustive promulgation of the advance of
progressive politics without countenance of how that activism has indelibly
changed all facets of the school. It is a particular facet of this experience
that I wish to dwell on. When dissecting the modern public school, the vantage
points for accumulation of progressive predilections are many. As active
institutions, schools must designate by some design what are the decisions that
will guide conduct of agents within on pragmatic and ideological grounds. This
should not be a surprise to anyone as any organization must formally develop and
envelop themselves as actors within some contextual framework.

## Invitation to Inquiry

What are the sources of philosophical inquiry that shape such an institution? Do
the subsequent policies developed give satisfactory answers to these questions?
Is the act of existence itself progress towards these inquiries? What is the
nature of the formalisms employed that service the institution? What is the
mission statement of the institution? Does the nature of the institution allow
for public analysis? Does the incumbent administration treat with hostility
discourse that is critical of the institution? Do they distinguish between
criticism aligned with their mission statement? These are answers that beg for
immediate remedial discovery and often their existence is a venture to
disambiguate between the lofty ambitions from the prima facie reality.

## Nature of this Inquiry

What I seek to extrapolate from this formal analysis of purpose is a proper
extrication of organizational will. What follows is an ambitious attempt to sate
my appetite for clarity. I wish to illuminate, with the formal apparatus
mentioned prior, to document what an inclusive institution is and what it is
not. When assay analysis of progressive politics, at times I become despondent
with the divergence I see in the earnest proclivities to act faithfully with the
high-minded idealism of progressivism and the postulate meandering of
*Realpolitik*. It is no design of mine to insist that the latter has no place;
surely the world as we know it would not be navigable without its triumph. What
I want is wave away the ambiguity that political actors often resort to when
they feel the encroachment of their political rivals.

## Hierarchical Scaffold of Theory Resting on a Substrate of Realism

Realism is no anodyne to the failure of idealism. Often the two are seen
competitors vying for the affection of humans. They are often presented as a
tense pairing where the expectation is that one party is moments away from
consuming the other.
