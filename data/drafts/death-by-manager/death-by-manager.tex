\begin{abstract}
    While popular discourse has focused on the role of the capitalist class in the prolonging of certain deprivations, the managerial class has escaped all culpability.
    This paper seeks to rectify this oversight by examining the rapacious tendencies of the managerial class and its role in the exploitation of the world.
    Exploitation is interpreted rather conservatively in this paper.
    Frankly, it is not needed.
    There will be no resorting to Marxist definitions to extract sensible attitudes to disposition one against the managerial class. Instead, the paper will focus on the managerial class, what they are, how they came to be, the consequences of their unattenuated power, and how to dispose oneself against them.
    You will find no panacea here; only sagacity and wisdom of the analytical word. What motivates this author to write this paper is the envisioning of a better world beyond the managerial horizon.
    A world where the resources of the world are not held hostage by a hostile, callous and neglectful interest.
    This can ours, reader.

\section{The Managerial Class}
A tragedy in the making can be spotted in the manner by which private interests can define the contours of popular discussions.
While the modern imagination is still hauntec by the trauma of the 20th century, there lurks a class of men and women, more detestable by action, than communists or capitalists.
I am of course referring to the managerial class.
Whatever be the country's specific ideological affiliation, it produces a niche for the same group of men that hazard an opportunity to sate their ambition.
