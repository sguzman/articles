\begin{abstract}
    One of the greatest intellectual crimes to beset us in the 20th-century was
    the premature death of the formalist program. The millennia old dream of
    \textit{solving math} was never realized as our efforts fell short of our
    ambition. David Hilbert, with all his grace, his effulgent brilliance, his
    professional magnanimity, and his unflinching dedication, was left with only
    disgruntled disappointment. The formalist program was a noble effort, held
    aloft by the unyielding conviction and charisma of the foremost
    mathematicians of the age. This forlorn vignette is rendered at least
    somewhat emotionally digestible by the developments that followed. The dream
    of \textbf{syntax is all} became partially realized by the contributions of Haskell
    Curry, Alonzo Church, Stephen Kleene, Moses Sch√∂nfinkel and others. With
    their syntactic approach to mathematics, we capture the compositional beauty
    of infinity in our humble symbol. And thus, we compile the syntactic face of God.

\section{The Tragedy of Formalism}
The death of the formalism program was a necessary tragedy for the advancement
of mathematics. Gone were the ensconced notions were the naive intuitions of
mathematical computation. Rather, it was the lack of such a computational
foundation for mathematics that needed to be addressed. It was around this time
that mathematicians began to rigorously define what it means for a statement to
be provable. Without a computational foundation, the notion of provability
rested on a tentative and ambiguous folklore. For this heroic death, we
inherited a proliferation of computable logical systems that could be used to
encode mathematical ideas and theorems. The program's death died for our crass
naivite and ensured the salvation of mathematics for the modern age. It is here
where we demark the beginning of computation.
\subsection{Poetry of Computation}
The poetry of computation is the poetry of the formalist program reborn.
Whether it be lambda calculus or combinatory logic, the accentuation of syntax
is what deliberately marks this change in tradition. What Frege set in motion
is that the story of math and logic is in part the story of syntax. And it is
with syntax that we seek to capture the semantics of mathematics. Whether we
behold the history of mathematical symbols establishing what we associate with
the mathematical arts, or modern compilers that bleed out the captured
semantics of a language to a hardware equivalent, syntax is the poetry of
computation. What the formalist program lacked in ultimate success, it made up
for in intuition and beauty.
\subsection{A Nightmare Embraced}
Of course, the program is not without its thorns. To assume that the program
must be a feasible one is to posit that mathematics is devoid of content beyond
its superficial and meaningless syntax. The inevitable progression of this
species of thought is that mathematics is a mere syntactic game. Any semantic
model we attach to this game must submit to the reality of being mere fiction.
And if this holds, then our notions of mathematics fall into the void of
nihilism and thus embrace the nightmare of extinction. This nightmare becomes a
wonderful dream only when coupled with a more human focused approach to
mathematics, such as intuitionism. I won't elaborate on what this latter
program entails suffice to say that it dulls the sting of the void. Once we
compliment our syntax program with a phenomenological narcotic, we can
comandeer the development of mathematics where the syntax demands and inject
our semantic creature comforts as an afterthought. After all, mathematics is a
inductive, deductive and analytical art; there is no room for a bleeding heart.
\subsection{The Gentle Promenade Down The Road to Perdition}
Let us follow this dreamy reverie down the whirlpool of damnation.

\section{Ambitions Laid Bare}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Reducing the algebra of distinctly nuanced algebraic objects onto simple
          arithmetic is the \textit{sine qua non} of the mathematics.
    \item The lofty ambition of all esoteric fields should be model-reduction to
          arithmetic.
    \item Whatever wanton discretion lead to The promulgation of arcane nomenclature must
          collapse to the imperative of simplicity.
    \item Nothing is simpler than the immeasurable simplicity of numbers.
