\begin{abstract}
Books capture the essence of knowledge distilled into a verbal consolidation. In
this sense the physical medium that constitutes the books proper is not what
compels attention. What truly continues to rapture our imagination is the
stability of the written word. Written documents have proven that communication
can be stored, transmitted, reproduced and expressed in a variety of ways. All
wealth of actions that the written word commands can be done all without every
modifying the original communication. This is the essence of the word and the
books that house them. This can only be done by accepting certain fungible
facets of words, books and knowledge. A word is a word and knowledge can be
built incrementally without regard to any purported \textbf{sine qua non} that may
lurk in the shadows. In this document, I make the case for the fungibility of
the written word.
