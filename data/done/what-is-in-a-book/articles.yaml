description: >
  An essay arguing that books are fungible at the level of their verbal content,
  exploring how a book’s “identity” can be modeled (imperfectly) via typed tuples,
  then reversing the usual emphasis on the author by treating words and semantic
  constraint as primary. It frames ambiguity as a core adversary of formal meaning
  and gestures toward a commutative “algebra of truth.”

abstract: |
  This essay asks what a book is, treating the “verbal book” (the total written
  content) as the main object of analysis rather than the physical artifact. It
  proposes a simple typed-tuple model for identifying books (author, title,
  edition) while acknowledging that any such formalism is incomplete without a
  theory of intention. The analysis then flips direction: rather than grounding a
  book in an author, it treats words as primary and authorial identity as
  downstream from the semantic space constrained by text. Ambiguity is presented
  as the persistent obstacle for any rigorous semantics, motivating the desire
  for a general “ambiguity theory.” The essay closes with a speculative proposal:
  truth should be modeled in a way that is less dependent on word order, aiming
  toward a commutative, set-like semantics—an “abelian algebra of epistemology.”
