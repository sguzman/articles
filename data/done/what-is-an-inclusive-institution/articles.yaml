description: >
  An essay arguing that institutional claims of “inclusivity” are not mere branding:
  they entail an obligation to invite inquiry, align rhetoric with mission and resources,
  and acknowledge the Realpolitik that makes idealistic aims possible.

abstract: |
  This essay treats modern schools as institutions shaped by progressive traditions and
  asks what it really means for a school to call itself “inclusive.” It frames
  inclusivity as a claim that invites inquiry into mission, formalisms, governance,
  and whether criticism is tolerated as part of public analysis. The essay then
  rejects a simplistic idealism-versus-realism dichotomy, proposing instead a
  hierarchy where lofty ideals rest on the enabling substrate of Realpolitik. On this
  view, rhetoric is accountable: if an institution cannot furnish resources and
  administrative appetite to realize the inclusive label, it should temper its claims
  and “recede its reach,” scaling ambitions to what its material capacity can sustain.
