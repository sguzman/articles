abstract: >-
  A polemical essay on the "death" of Hilbert-style formalism and its rebirth as a
  computational poetics of syntax. It argues that the naive formalist program
  failed for lacking an adequate computational foundation for provability, but
  that its legacy lives on in modern formal systems. The piece then sketches an
  ambitious research direction: a syntactic/algebraic framework for iterating
  functions (with polynomials as a testing ground), using types, currying, and an
  operator-indexing scheme inspired by Gödel-style encodings to reason about the
  dynamics of iterated operations.
