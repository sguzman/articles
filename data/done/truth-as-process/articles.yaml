description: >
  An essay arguing that the halting problem’s “paradox” is partly a self-imposed
  constraint: demanding a point answer to a line-shaped process. It proposes
  treating truth as something that can be conferred by an evolving process rather
  than a single atomic verdict.

abstract: |
  This essay revisits the halting problem as a case study in how intellectual tools
  can be treated as sacred rather than adjustable. It argues that “paradox” often
  arises from insisting on rigid, point-like truth conditions for phenomena that are
  inherently process-shaped. On that basis, it sketches a modest “solution” to the
  halting problem by extending truth from a single moment to a time-extended
  procedure: output “no” by default, run the process, and only if execution returns
  emit “yes.” The essay closes by generalizing the idea as “truth as process,”
  pointing to probabilistic confidence and distributed-systems tradeoffs as familiar
  domains where correctness can be understood as eventual or tolerance-bounded.
