	\section{Introduction}
	The extraordinary purchase that the intellectual blossoming mathematics experienced is beyond reproach. This certain scholarly field, as an academic discipline and as a practical application to engineering problems, is the quintessential success story for why raw intellectualism often delivers on its promises. To say that this field found success with the more prudishly pragmatic elements of society is to deprive mathematics of the many splendid laurels that intend to pay dividends commensurate with the prosperity of humanity.
