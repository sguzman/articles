- [x] truth as a process
- [ ] interpration-agnostic interpretation of algebraic equations
- [ ] infinity as intractibility of domain specific toolset
- [ ] non-naive interpretation of recursion to offer halting-proof encoding of infinite recursion
- [ ] math as divinely inspired
- [ ] logic as justified cause and effect
- [ ] symbols as ambiguity circumscription
- [ ] How not to read a book (disabusing perfect comprehension)
- [ ] Banality of epistomology (books are interchangeable in knowledge content because wisdom is fungible)
- [ ] Male violence as the norm (we cannot see it because it is assumed)
