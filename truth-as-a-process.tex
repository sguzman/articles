	\section{Introduction}
	
	The Halting Problem and all the pedagogical discourse surrounding it always struck me as a bit odd.
	
	\section{Introduction}
	
	This paper illustrates how various typesetting is accomplished in \LaTeX.
	You are encouraged to view both the source code ({\tt sample.tex}) 
	and the typeset paper ({\tt sample.dvi}). 
	
	First, notice that components of your paper such as {\it sections, subsections,} and 
	{\it equations} are numbered automatically.  
	
	\subsection{Lists}
	Making an itemized list is easy:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If the \LaTeX~ file is called {\tt sample.tex} then output is created by
		executing \\
		{\tt latex sample} \\
		This creates a file {\tt sample.dvi}.
		To view or print, see documentation for your system.
		\item Note that leaving one or more blank lines
		in the input
		gives the start of a new paragraph.  Otherwise blanks
		do not   matter.  % and this is a comment that won't print.
		To force a line to end, use double backslash as in the previous item as seen in {\tt sample.tex}.
		
		\item Anything after a \% is a comment that won't appear in the output.
		% so you need to use the special macro \% if you want % to show up!!
	\end{itemize}
	
	\section{Mathematical formulas}
	
	% This is a citation.  Look at the bibliography to see the reference!
	This paper supplies only a taste of how mathematical formulas are created in \LaTeX.  
	For more information, see a \LaTeX~ manual such as \cite{go-mi-sa:latex}.  
	As a short introduction, a few pointers are contained in this section. 
	
	Dollar signs places \LaTeX~ into its math mode, which is where mathematical formulas and equations
	are created.  To include an equation in a current line of text, place one dollar sign (\$) before 
	and after the equation, for example we might define $f(x) = 3e^x$.   If an equation should be displayed,
	place two dollar signs (\$\$) before and after the equation.  For example, we might define:
	$$
	\sum_{j=1}^N j = \frac{N(N+1)}{2}.
	$$
	If the equation should be numbered, use the following notation (see the \LaTeX~ file):
	\begin{equation}  
		e^{i\pi} = \cos(\pi) = -1.
		\label{cosequation}
	\end{equation}
	This equation was given a label (which is optional).  Hence, the equation
	can be referred to later as (\ref{cosequation}) rather than hardcoding such numbers into
	the \LaTeX~ file.  Therefore, adding new equations does not facilitate a need for the programmer 
	to manually renumber the equations. 
	(Note that you will have to run \LaTeX~ twice on your {\tt .tex}
	file for numbering to appear properly.  The first run stores the labels in
	the file {\tt sample.aux} and the second time run reads these labels at the
	beginning of processing.)
	
	\section{Matrices}
	
	Matrices can be made using an ``array''.  Here's a useful definition that 
	makes it easier to define matrices:  (see the \LaTeX~ source file)
	\newenvironment{mat}{\left[\begin{array}{ccccccccccccc}}{\end{array}\right]}
	
	Here's a simple matrix equation using this definition:
	\begin{equation}
		\begin{mat} a_{11} & a_{12} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} \end{mat}
		\begin{mat} x_1\\ x_2 \end{mat}
		= \begin{mat} b_1\\ b_2 \end{mat}
		\label{matrixequation}
	\end{equation}
	
	\section{Figures}
	Many plotting packages (e.g. matlab) allow you to produce an encapsulated
	postscript file (ending in {\tt .eps}).   Then the graphic can be incorporated
	into a paper with the following command (see the \LaTeX~ file)
	
	\begin{figure}
		\caption{\label{figlabel} Histogram of 1000 normally distributed random
			numbers.}
	\end{figure}
	
	Note that the {\tt caption} command gives the figure a number that can be referred
	to later as Figure \ref{figlabel}.
	
	The file {\tt fig.eps} was created in matlab with the commands:
	\begin{verbatim}
		>> r = randn(1000,1);
		>> hist(r)             
		>> colormap([.7 .7 .7])    % to change the color and make it print better
		>> print fig.eps
	\end{verbatim}
	
	
	\section{Bibliography and citations}
	See a \LaTeX~ manual such as \cite{go-mi-sa:latex}
	for complete information on the use of a bibliography and citations.  The 
	main idea is the use of a bibliographic
	database such as the one in {\tt samplebib.bib}, which lists a large set of papers and
	books, each with a distinct label.  Then the  {\tt cite} command references one of the entries in
	the database by its label.  Hence, the citation is included in the paper; the corresponding reference 
	is automatically included in the bibliography of the paper.  To do this, you must:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item First run {\tt latex sample}
		\item Then run {\tt bibtex sample}
		\item Then run {\tt latex sample}
		\item Then run {\tt latex sample}
	\end{enumerate}
	The first run of \LaTeX~ creates a file {\tt sample.aux}
	that contains information on the literature references.
	Running bibtex then creates another file {\tt sample.bbl}, which is read into
	the next \LaTeX~ run producing the list of literature references.  
	Running \LaTeX~ twice more is needed to read in the citations with proper numbering. 
	
	\bibliographystyle{plain}   % tells how to format bibliographic entries
	\bibliography{samplebib}    % tells that the database is in samplebib.bib
